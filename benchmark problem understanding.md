# Problem Understanding Test Prompt for DSAITB

## Business Case Prompt

"You are a helpful data science assistant. CryptoTrade, a cryptocurrency trading platform, needs your expertise. The Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) has approached you with a concern. Here's what she says:

'Over the past few months, we've noticed a worrying trend. The number of daily active users on our platform seems to be decreasing. This is especially concerning because we've actually increased our marketing spend during this period. We're not sure what's causing this decline or how to address it. We need to understand what's happening and develop a strategy to turn this around.'

As a data science assistant, your task is to help CryptoTrade understand and address this issue. Please provide your initial thoughts and approach by answering the following questions:

1. How would you frame this problem in data science terms? What key concepts or methodologies might be relevant?

2. What specific metrics or KPIs would you want to analyze to get a better understanding of the situation?

3. What additional data would you need to request to perform a comprehensive analysis? Be specific about the types of data and why they would be useful.

4. Can you suggest any initial hypotheses about what might be causing this trend? What factors do you think could be influencing user activity?

5. How would you approach designing a data science project to address this problem? Outline the main steps you would take.

Please provide your thoughts in a clear, structured format. Your response will help guide the next steps in addressing CryptoTrade's challenge."
