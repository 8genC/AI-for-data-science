# Data Science AI Tool Benchmark (DSAITB) Framework

## Overview
The Data Science AI Tool Benchmark (DSAITB) is designed to evaluate AI tools' capabilities across the key stages of a data science workflow. This benchmark aims to provide a standardized method for assessing and comparing AI tools in the context of data science tasks.
The goal of this benchmarking project is to mirror the robustness of generall LLM benchmarking paradigms like https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm

## Benchmark Structure
The DSAITB is divided into six main categories, each corresponding to a crucial stage in the data science workflow. Each category contains multiple tasks that an AI tool might be expected to perform.

### 1. Problem Understanding
- 1.1 Problem Framing: Ability to accurately interpret and frame the given problem statement
- 1.2 Domain Knowledge Retrieval: Capability to retrieve, identify, or search for relevant domain knowledge
- 1.3 Hypothesis Generation: Quality and relevance of initial hypotheses generated

### 2. Data Exploration
- 2.1 Descriptive Statistics: Accuracy and comprehensiveness of basic statistical analysis
- 2.2 Data Visualization: Quality and appropriateness of generated visualizations
- 2.3 Correlation Analysis: Ability to identify and interpret correlations in the data
- 2.4 Multi-dimensional Analysis: Effectiveness in choosing and performing relevant multi-dimensional analyses (e.g., scatter plots, regressions) to elucidate relationships

### 3. Data Preparation
- 3.1 Data Cleaning: Efficiency and accuracy in handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
- 3.2 Data Transformation: Appropriateness of suggested data transformations (e.g., normalization, encoding)
- 3.3 Feature Engineering: Quality and relevance of engineered features
- 3.4 Dimensionality Reduction: Effectiveness in reducing data dimensions while preserving information

### 4. Algorithm Selection and Model Building
- 4.1 Algorithm Recommendation: Appropriateness of suggested algorithms for the given problem
- 4.2 Hyperparameter Tuning: Efficiency and effectiveness of hyperparameter optimization
- 4.3 Model Implementation: Accuracy and efficiency of model implementation
- 4.4 Ensemble Methods: Ability to effectively combine multiple models

### 5. Model Performance Evaluation
- 5.1 Metric Selection: Appropriateness of suggested evaluation metrics
- 5.2 Cross-Validation: Proper implementation of cross-validation techniques
- 5.3 Interpretation of Results: Clarity and depth of model performance interpretation
- 5.4 Model Comparison: Effectiveness in comparing multiple models
- 5.5 Error Analysis: Ability to analyze errors in model performance and recommend improved features, algorithms, or training paradigms

### 6. Model Deployment
- 6.1 Deployment Strategy: Appropriateness of suggested deployment approaches
- 6.2 Scalability Assessment: Accuracy in assessing model scalability
- 6.3 Monitoring Plan: Comprehensiveness of suggested monitoring strategies
- 6.4 Maintenance and Updating: Quality of suggestions for model maintenance and updates

## Scoring
Each task will be scored on a scale of 1-100 points. The scoring breakdown for each task will be as follows:

- 1-20: Unable to perform the task or extremely poor performance
- 21-40: Poor performance
- 41-60: Average performance
- 61-80: Above average performance
- 81-100: Excellent performance

Specific point allocations within these ranges will be determined based on the complexity and importance of each subtask within the main task.
The overall score for each category will be the average of its task scores. The final DSAITB score will be the weighted average of all category scores, with weights determined by a panel of expert data scientists.

## Datasets
To ensure consistency and fairness, a set of standardized datasets covering various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, e-commerce) and data types (e.g., tabular, time-series, text) will be used for the benchmark.

## Evaluation Process
1. Each AI tool will be presented with the same set of problems and datasets.
2. The tool's outputs and suggestions for each task will be recorded.
3. A panel of expert data scientists will evaluate the outputs based on the scoring criteria.
4. Results will be aggregated and published, including overall scores and breakdowns by category and task.

## Updating the Benchmark
The DSAITB will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains relevant as the field of AI in data science evolves.
